## Whole Numbers {#whole-numbers}

In order to understand complex numbers, we will start with the first numbers ever used by humans. We use whole numbers like 1, 2, and 3 for counting things. These numbers sufficed for a large portion of human history.


## Zero {#zero}

The concept of _zero_ seems obvious to us, but it did not come as easily as whole numbers to our ancestors.


## Negative Numbers {#negative-numbers}

Because numbers were mostly used for counting, the concept of a _negative_ number was hard for many to swallow. How could you have -3 apples? Ancient mathematicians would argue that the equation {{<katex>}}x+1=0{{</katex>}} has no solution. After all, how could you get one apple and end up with none?

Many people now know the uses of negative numbers. The concept of -3 apples does infact have a reasonable meaning. Gaining -3 apples is the same as losing 3. Another way to think about it is to ask the question "after gaining 3 apples, how many apples do I have to lose to break even?" This is like solving the equation {{<katex>}}x+3=0{{</katex>}}.


## Imaginary Numbers {#imaginary-numbers}

In the same way that the equation {{<katex>}}x+1=0{{</katex>}} lead to negative numbers, the equation {{<katex>}}x^2=-1{{</katex>}} lead to imaginary numbers.
